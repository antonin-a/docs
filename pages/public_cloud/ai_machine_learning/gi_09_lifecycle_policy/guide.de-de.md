updated: 2023-09-19

## Objective

This document is intended for our OVHcloud end customers and aims at providing information about the lifecycle of the [AI Notebooks, AI Training, AI Deploy](https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/public-cloud/ai-machine-learning/) IT products in the OVHcloud Public Cloud.

We aim at ensuring a clear understanding of the maintenance, upgrade and decommissioning stages of the products to ensure a continuous and reliable experience. This document is not contractual and has no legal basis. It is the desire of the OVHcloud teams to provide the best possible service to their customers.

## Products maintenance

### Objective

The aim of the maintenance phase is to ensure that our products continue to function correctly throughout their use by our customers.

### Key activities

- **Technical support**: Main support is provided via the OVHcloud support channels (i.e. ticket creation via the console, support telephone number). In addition, the AI teams are available via [Discord](https://discord.gg/ovhcloud) and dedicated channels to answer your questions and resolve technical issues.
- **Patches**: In the event of bugs or security issues, patches will be developed and deployed to maintain products stability.
- **Minor Enhancements**: We are constantly working to improve your experience by incorporating minor enhancements to optimise performance and usability.

### Customer constraints linked to AI products maintenance activities

On AI Notebooks images, particularly in the event of a security problem, we may no longer offer a version of a framework or library.  As upward compatibility is not guaranteed, this could render older Notebook backups inoperative. We therefore **advise our customers to back up their data and results regularly** and in an independent storage.
On containers running on AI Training and AI Deploy, we may have to restart the platform and your processing will therefore be halted. Except in the event of a security problem requiring an immediate restart without prior notice, we will notify you via [Discord](https://discord.gg/ovhcloud) and the restart will take place within 7 days of the announcement.

## Product updates

### Objective

Updates are essential to keep the products up to date, secure and adapted to your changing needs.

### Key activities

- **Updates planning**: We will keep you informed of the next scheduled updates.
- **Development**: Updates include new features, security enhancements and patches.
- **Rigorous testing**: Before each update, extensive tests are carried out to ensure stability.
- **Communication**: We'll keep you informed of new features and important changes, including via a [Discord](https://discord.gg/ovhcloud) post.

### Customer constraints relating to products maintenance activities

For AI notebook images, we plan to maintain the images with the latest versions of frameworks and libraries. However, to enable you to migrate your data and results to the most up-to-date versions, we will maintain the latest 3 versions of each image online. We will remove the oldest of these three images when a new, more up-to-date version is released. We therefore advise our customers to back up their data and results regularly and in and independent storage, and to switch as soon as possible to the most recent version of the images available. A notebook running on an obsolete image may be shut down within 7 days. We advise our customers to follow the image update cycle.

On containers running on AI Training and AI Deploy, we may have to restart the platform every 7 days and your processing will therefore be stopped. If you expect your processing to last longer than 7 days, we advise you to contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ovhcloud) so that we can organise a postponement with you, on an exceptional basis.

## Products decommissioning

### Objective

The products will evolve and eventually reach the end of their lifecycles. Our objective is to facilitate this transition smoothly.

### Key activities

- **Communication**: We will inform you well in advance of the planned decommissioning date.
- **Data Transfer**: We will assist you with the transfer of data to an alternative solution, where appropriate.
